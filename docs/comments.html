                           # Normal comments

#[ 
   A short comment starts with a sharp sign (#) anywhere 
   outside a string and it extends to the end of the line.
#]

var q = "c++, c#, lua" # this is comment



#[ 
    Block comment starts with #[ sequence and ends with #]
    It allows to comment several lines or part of the line in the middle.
#]

var w = "w"
#[
this is
a multiline
comment
#]
var t #[ comment in the middle #] = "t"



#[ 
    Block comments support nesting as well.
#]

var i = "i"
#[ this is a
comment #[ this is nested comment #]
this is also a comment
 #] var d = "d" 



#[ 
    Line with comment-begin marker can be commented-out itself.
    This makes it easy to enable or disable whole block of code.
#]

##[ this comment-begin marker is commented out
var f = "f"
var g = "g"
#] var h = "h"



#[ 
    Commented out markers are still counted correctly when nested.     
#]

var j = "j"
#[
var k = "k" 
##[ this comment-begin marker is commented out
var f = "f"
var g = "g"
#] var h = "h"
var x = "x" 
#]
var v = "v" 



# 
#    There is also special #[# syntax to 'backward-comment'
#    begin marker. It is useful when needed temporary
#    uncomment block in the middle of the line.
#

if a == b #[ and c == d #] then

if a == b ##[ and c == d #] then

if a == b #[# and c == d #] then


                           # Binding comments

#[ 
    There are also alternative syntax of comments for binding purpose.
    
    It allows to mix C++ and kuku code in one source file.
    Where kuku comments contains valid C++ and vice versa.
    
    Single line comment start by /* sequence
    Multiline comments starts with */ and ends with /*
    Nesting is not supported.
#]


/* single line comment
var a = "valid ku-ku code"
*/ #include <iostream>

int main() { /* var b = "more ku-ku code" */
    std::cout << "valid c++ code";
    return 0;
} /*
